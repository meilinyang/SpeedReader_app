    <string name="string_read">When an application is launched, the system creates a thread of execution for the application, called "main."
        This thread is very important because it is in charge of dispatching events to the appropriate user interface widgets, including draw
        ing events. It is also the thread in which your application interacts with components from the Android UI toolkit (components from the
        android.widget and android.view packages). As such, the main thread is also sometimes called the UI thread.!</string>
